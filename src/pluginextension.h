/**
 * Structure serving as an interface between plugins and Geany allowing
 * plugins to inform Geany about what features they provide and allowing
 * Geany to delegate its functionality to the plugins.
 * 
 * Depending on the functionality they provide, plugins should assign pointers
 * to the functions implementing this interface to the appropriate members of
 * the structure. Not all of the functions have to be implemented by the
 * plugin - member pointers of unimplemented functions can be left to contain
 * the @c NULL pointer.
 * 
 * Typically, functions from this interface come in pairs. Functions assigned to
 * the members ending with @c _provided inform Geany whether the plugin
 * implements the given feature for the passed document. Functions assigned
 * to the members ending with @c _perform are called by Geany at appropriate
 * moments to inform the plugin when to perform the given feature.
 * 
 * The extension is defined by the pointers in the PluginExtension structure and
 * is registered in Geany using the @c plugin_extension_register() function.
 * 
 * @warning The API provided by this file is subject to change and should not be
 * considered stable at this point. That said, it is highly probable that if
 * a change of this API is required in the future, it will not be of a major
 * nature and should not require major modifications of the affected plugins
 * (e.g. added/modified parameter of a function and similar changes).
